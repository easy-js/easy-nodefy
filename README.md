# easy-nodefy

convert AMD modules into a node.js compatible format.



## How?

This tool uses [Esprima](http://esprima.org/) to parse the code and replace
`define()` calls, doing the less amount of changes as possible to the code.

### Input

```js
define(['foo', '../bar/baz'], function(foo, baz){

  var lorem = 'ipsum';

  return {
    log : function(){
      console.log(lorem);
    }
  };

});
```

### Output

```js
  var foo = require('foo');
  var baz = require('../bar/baz');

  var lorem = 'ipsum';

  module.exports = {
    log : function(){
      console.log(lorem);
    }
  };
```


## CLI

You can use it as a CLI tool:

```
[sudo] npm install -g nodefy
nodefy -o cjs "src/**.js"
```

This will convert all ".js" files inside the `src` folder and put the results
on the `cjs` folder.

It also works with `stdin` and `stdout`:

```
cat "src/foo.js" | nodefy
```

For a list of available options run:

```
nodefy -h
```


## Standalone Lib

It is also available as a regular node.js library.

```js
var nodefy = require('nodefy');

// nodefy.parse(string)
// returns node.js style module
var cjsModule = nodefy.parse(jsString);

// nodefy.convert(inputPath [, outputPath], callback)
// if outputPath is omitted it won't write the result
nodefy.convert('foo.js', function(err, result){
  console.log(result);
});

// nodefy.batchConvert(glob [, outputFolder], callback)
// if outputFolder is omitted it won't write the result
nodefy.batchConvert('src/**.js', 'cjs', function(err, results){
  // results is an array of {sourcePath, outputPath, result}
});
```


## Inspiration / Why?

I couldn't find any tool that did what I wanted - convert AMD modules into
plain node.js - so I decided to code my own. There are alternatives but they
all add more complexity than I wanted.

This project was created mainly because of
[amd-utils](http://millermedeiros.github.com/amd-utils/), since many methods
are useful on both environments.

The name was inpired by
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).



## Features, Goals & Limitations

The [Asynchronous Module
Definition](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) is very flexible, it
supports [plugins](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/Loader-Plugins),
many [configuration
settings](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/Common-Config) to define how
modules should be loaded and asynchronous module loading.

**This tool aims to convert basic modules**, plugins and advanced settings
probably are NOT going to be supported in the near future (I have plans to
support basic configs, see [issue 6](https://github.com/millermedeiros/nodefy/issues/6)).
Check the [uRequire](https://github.com/anodynos/uRequire) project in case you need
something more complex or create a new feature request on the [issues
tracker](https://github.com/millermedeiros/nodefy/issues).
